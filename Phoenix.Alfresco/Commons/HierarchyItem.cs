Subject: Phoenix.CMIS v1 â€“ Alfresco Integration Milestone Achieved ðŸš€

Body:

Hey team,

Just wrapping up version 1 of the Phoenix.CMIS Alfresco integrationâ€”and I wanted to quickly highlight what we've accomplished in this release.

âœ… Key Highlights:

Fully modular AlfrescoClient with support for authentication, browsing, upload, and folder management

Streaming and paged traversal support (StreamDescendantsAsync, ListChildrenPageAsync) with optional filtering delegates

Centralized request pipeline abstraction (SendAlfrescoRequestAsync) with structured logging and robust error handling

Unified result composition via Result<T> extension methods (WithLogging, AppendContext, FailFromResponseAsync)

JSON model binding separated via modular binders (NodeBinder, VersionBinder)

Cancellation and error propagation support across all recursive and I/O-heavy methods

Clean architecture focused on reusability, maintainability, and observability

Weâ€™ve drawn a clear line between core functionality and future extensibility. Some advanced featuresâ€”like parallel traversal, hierarchy projections, and diagnostics overlaysâ€”are reserved for v2 to keep this release lean and strategic.

Thanks for everyoneâ€™s input and collaboration so far. v1 is fast, modular, and ready for integration. Let me know if you'd like me to walk you through the structure or share API usage patterns.

On to the next sprint ðŸ’ª â€”Nelson
